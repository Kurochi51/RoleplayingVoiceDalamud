This plugin lets you have a fairly decent and player synced character voice that mimics the text you write!

Players nearby with the same plugin will be able to hear your characters AI voice.

This plugin also allows players to have a much more flexible and unlimited creativity with custom character voice packs.

This is the repo link for installation in dalamud:
```

```

You will need to have an Eleven labs account to have an AI voice, and get your API key

Hit save, pick a voice and you are done!
You can use the Elevenlabs website to make more voices.

In order to sync your character voice with other players you will need to enable connection to a sync server and whitelist players you want to hear.
